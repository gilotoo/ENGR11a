                            <p class="card-text">OWe began our project by unboxing our Prusa Mini package and separated all the parts (mise en place). Following the manual, we were able to assemble the printer by following step by step instructions provided in the manual. The assembly included combining the y and z axis of the printer, assembling the x-axis and extruder, assembling the print head and heatbed and finally, assembling the LCD and electronics. Once the printer was fully assembled, we then loaded it with a filament color of our choosing.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">While constructing our printer, we ran into just a single issue once the assembly was almost complete. When loading the filament toward the end of the assembly, the filament was not able to fully enter through the tube in the printer. This issue was eventually fixed by having to loosen the filament holder and reinsert the filament tube connection. This method eventually solved the problem and the printer was able to operate normally!</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">After completely constructing the Prusa Mini Printer, we were left with a couple reflections for improvements. We  concluded that the manual could have included more detailed images of the steps of the building process. Overall, we found the assembly process to be straightforward but challenging in the best way. Our group enjoyed the fact that a majority of the assembly was just placing built pieces together and not having to fully construct the printer from scratch.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Our next step of the process was to calibrate the printer so we could print our first model. The calibration process was more simple than the assembly process. For calibration, my partner (Daniel) and I had to go to the 'calibration' option on the printer once we turned it on. After we selected that option, the printer began a process of placing continuous lines of filament in a maze pattern on the heatbed. Or task during calibration was to change the z-axis height of the nozzle extruding the filament so the extrusion would stick to the heatbed just right. </p>

Once we understood that the dial on the printer moves the nozzle in very small increments, we were less lenient with the amount of turns needed to change the height of the nozzle. Now that we have the printer calibrated, it was time to print our first design!</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Now that we had our printer built and calibrated it was time to print. Our first print was already downloaded onto the hard drive provided in the assembly. The print design was called "3D Benchy '' and it was a design of a mini tugboat with many different dimensions included. We retrieved the file for the model from the Prusa website and placed the model in our CAD program (Prusa Slicer). We took a look at the different specs for the print. Once we were satisfied, we exported the file onto the hard drive. We plugged the hard drive in and let the printer run the print. At the end, the print ran smoothly and came out with the exact model we were hoping for.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">After completing a successful build, we wanted to decrease the print time of our model by tinkering the settings in our Prusa Slicer program. We exported the same file onto the Prusa Slicer software and made changes to the specs of the model. We increased the layer height and first layer height, decreased the amount of solid layers, decreased shell thickness, changed seam position, decreased infill density, and changed the infill pattern. Overall, this decreased the time to print from an hour to 42 minutes.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">Overall the print process went very smoothly. We were able to complete these prints without running into any printer malfunctions or software issues. Comparing the first and second print, you can see physically where the changes are in the print models in comparison to one another. Having to put the file onto Prusa Slicer is also a straightforward process and the software makes it easy to follow.</p>

I am a transfer student here at Brandeis that was originally pursuing a degree in biomedical engineering at Trinity College. I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in biophysics with a minor in finance. I am also a player on the men;s basketball team here at Brandeis. I have a true passion for the STEM department, especially mathematics and biology. I believe that you can do so much good for the world with the knowledge that STEM courses provide. With the being said, my goal is to accumulate as much knowledge as I can about the physical world and use that knowledge in the medical and financial field to help support my community back home in Accra, Ghana.
